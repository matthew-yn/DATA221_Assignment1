Assignment1_Question1.py  
Implements a controlled multiplication loop that multiplies consecutive integers starting from 1 until the product exceeds a given threshold. The program prints the final product and the integer that caused the threshold to be exceeded.

Assignment1_Question2.py  
Defines a function that takes a list of strings and returns a nested dictionary. Each key is a string from the list, and each value contains the string’s length and whether that length is even or odd.

Assignment1_Question3.py  
Defines a power function and safely applies it to a list of `(x, y)` pairs. Pairs with negative exponents are skipped, and valid results are stored and printed in a list.

Assignment1_Question4.py  
Generates a list of random values between 0 and 1, sorts the list, and finds the first index where a value is greater than or equal to a randomly generated number `x`.

Assignment1_Question5.py  
Defines a function that validates two circle radii, computes their areas, and returns the percentage of the larger circle’s area that can be covered by the smaller circle.

Assignment1_Question6.py  
Analyzes a list of numbers and returns a dictionary where each key is a unique value from the list, and each value is the percentage of elements less than or equal to that key. The dictionary is sorted by key.

Assignment1_Question7.py  
Converts a given number of seconds since midnight into hours, minutes, seconds, and AM/PM format.
